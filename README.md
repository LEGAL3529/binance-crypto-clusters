# Crypto Market Cluster Analysis

Jupyter Notebook for advanced clustering and segmentation of the entire Binance USDT-crypto universe by behavioral similarity and dependence on Bitcoin.


# Project Goal

- Segment and visualize all USDT crypto assets from Binance by statistical similarity and beta to BTC.
- Find clusters: groups of coins that move together, BTC-followers, and truly independent or anti-Bitcoin tokens.
- Highlight outliers (anomalies) â€” assets fundamentally different from the market.
- Automate market exploration for quant research, trading ideas, and portfolio construction.


# Contents

- Loading historical OHLCV data for all Binance USDT-pairs (up to 1000 days)
- Feature engineering: calculating volatility, RSI, beta vs BTC, volume, and more
- Modern clustering:
    - UMAP for dimensionality reduction and visualization
    - HDBSCAN and KMeans for cluster detection and anomaly search
- 2D market maps, outlier detection, identification of the most independent altcoins
- Practical blocks: filtering, cluster analysis, exporting results
